# pocket-judge

Client work under the Development team of the Computer Society of the Ateneo.

This app is the mobile implementation of the design created by Apollo Clark Co, BFA Information Design '16 of the Ateneo de Manila University.

Pocket Judge was envisioned to be the "decision-making app for the everyday indecisive." It allowed users to enter the decisions they faced in their life, rank the choices they can make based on factors like timeliness and cost, and the app produces the best decision by weighting these factors.

The app is available on the [Apple App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/ph/app/pocket-judge/id1099025003?mt=8).
